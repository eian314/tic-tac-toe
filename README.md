# Tic Tac Toe Two

Tic Tac Toe Two is a web-based implementation of a variation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. In this version, two players compete to complete a row of three 'T's, with added mechanics to address common issues in the traditional game.

## Game Rules

- **Player One** starts first and can add a vertical or horizontal line in one of the board squares.
- **Player Two** can either complete a partially completed square or add a new line in an empty square.
- The game continues until one player completes a row, column, or diagonal of three 'T's.
- A square with a completed 'T' cannot be clicked again.
- A player cannot complete a 'T' from the previous player's last turn.

## Game UI

- The game has a clean and bold look and feel.
- The UI is responsive and supports mobile, desktop, and tablet devices.
- The game displays the current player's turn and highlights it in red or blue.
- A start button allows players to start or restart the game.
- Completed 'T's are shown in green to indicate the winning condition.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
3. Players take turns clicking on empty or partially completed squares to add vertical or horizontal lines.
4. The first player to complete a row, column, or diagonal of three 'T's wins.
